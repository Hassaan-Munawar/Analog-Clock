🕰️ Introducing My Latest Project: An Analog 3D Clock!

I'm thrilled to share my latest project, a fully functional analog 3D clock, which showcases my passion for blending creativity and technical skill. 🎨💻

This project started as a challenge to create a clock that not only tells time but also serves as a captivating piece of art. The design features:

3D Visualization: A realistic analog clock face with hands that move in real time, giving a tangible sense of time passing. ⏳

Interactivity: Users can interact with the clock through a smooth, responsive interface, making the experience more engaging. 👆

Customization: Options to change colors, textures, and backgrounds to match any aesthetic preference. 🎨✨

This project has been a great learning experience and a lot of fun to create. Feel free to try out the clock!
